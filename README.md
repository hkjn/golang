Repo golang holds the source files for the `hkjn/armv7l-golang` image.

* TODO(hkjn): Using this image as base, create hkjn.me/builds repo,
which runs on sc1 host and triggers docker build && docker push to
public hub when receiving
https://build.hkjn.me/hkjn.me/bitcoin/b29jZWlYYWZvaGdoYWljNGVwaG9oMG9vUGhvb3NhCg,
which is registered as GitHub webhook for hkjn.me/bitcoin repo.*
